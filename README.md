# PokerBotJava
Fourth Year project poker bot, written in java using my own code and hand evaluator. changes to hand evaluator need to be made, other various testing still needs to be done. Parser completed, inital starting hand values were designed for heads up. Overall values are placeholder. Does not track specific case where Ace is used for lower straight, easy fix include in straight calculations rank=13,2,3,4,5 would account for straight. Need to implement potential outs and work in values for these.
